## Challenge Overview
  
 Overall this is an excellent script that can be used to analyze other elections. Provivding concise results of how candidates and counties performed, how many votes were counted, the amount of votes each county received, the amount of votes each candidate received, offer percentages for each, and inform you who was the winner and by how much. It shows a clear overview of the election turnout, and narrows in on comparisons.

In future elections, the script can be modified to provide a more in depth analysis. We can include the voter turnout, by including the total population and comparing the amount of voters. Demographics can also be included and measure what demographics voted and for who. There are a variety of additions that could be included that would provide a greater in depth overview.
